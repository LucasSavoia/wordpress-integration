## About

VTEX IO's WordPress Integration app provides a way to bring in blog data from a WordPress installation and create a blog "homepage", category pages, and blog post pages on your VTEX IO store, using your existing store header, footer, and styling.

## Installation & Configuration

1. Install this app from the VTEX App Store;
2. In the admin dashboard, access `Apps > My Apps` and then click the box for `Wordpress Integration`;
3. Configure the following settings:
- `Wordpress URL` is required for the integration to function. This should be the domain where the WordPress API endpoint is hosted and WordPress is administered.
- `Title tag for blog homepage` will determine the title tag for the WordPress portions of your store.
4. In your store-theme, add this app as a dependency in `manifest.json`:
`"peerDependencies": {
  "vtex.wordpress-integration": "2.x"
}`
5. In your store-theme, add the **routes** and **blocks** for your store's WordPress content. For detailed instructions, please see the [full documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/vtex-apps/wordpress-integration).
